        <h3 class="header">Starting</h3>
        <p>I wrote my first lines of code 10 months ago, started with Basic HTML and CSS. It was really intresting and tasking at first but with regular practice it became easier. After about 4 months, it became very difficult to learn new things on my own especially learning JavaScript.</p>

        <h3 class="header">Where i am now</h3>
        <p>After talking to some experienced guys in the industry, i was adviced to join a Bootcamp for a strutured learning enivornment; i did some research and found <a href="https://www.stutern.com/">Stutern</a> to be a perfect fit for me. I signed up and started my journey on 25/11/2019. </p>
