        <h1>IN THE SMALL HOURS</h1>

        <p>
 Blue diaphane, tobacco smoke <br>
Serpentine on wet film and wood glaze,<br>
Mutes chrome, wreathes velvet drapes,<br>
Dims the cave of mirrors. Ghost fingers<br>
Comb seaweed hair, stroke acquamarine veins<br>
Of marooned mariners, captives<br>
Of Circe's sultry notes. The barman<br>
Dispenses igneous potions ?<br>
Somnabulist, the band plays on.<br>
<br>
Cocktail mixer, silvery fish<br>
Dances for limpet clients.<br>
Applause is steeped in lassitude,<br>
Tangled in webs of lovers' whispers<br>
And artful eyelash of the androgynous.<br>
The hovering notes caress the night<br>
Mellowed deep indigo ?still they play.<br>
<br>
Departures linger. Absences do not<br>
Deplete the tavern. They hang over the haze<br>
As exhalations from receded shores. Soon,<br>
Night repossesses the silence, but till dawn<br>
The notes hold sway, smoky<br>
Epiphanies, possessive of the hours.<br>
<br>
This music's plaint forgives, redeems<br>
The deafness of the world. Night turns<br>
Homewards, sheathed in notes of solace, pleats<br>
The broken silence of the heart<br>
